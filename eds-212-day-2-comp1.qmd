## Derivatives in R

```{r}
# create a function
fx <- expression(3.1 * x^4 - 28 * x)

# get the derivative and store it
df_dx <- D(fx, 'x')

# call it back
df_dx

x <- 10

# evaluate derivative at x = 10
eval(df_dx)

```

Find the slope of g(z) = 2z^3^ -10.5z^2^ +4.1 at z = 3.6.

```{r}
gz <- expression((2 * z^3) - (10.5 * z^2) + 4.1)

dg_dz <- D(gz, 'z')

z <- 3.6

eval(dg_dz)

z <- seq(from = 1, to = 3, length = 20)

eval(dg_dz)

```
